# Cybersecurity Realtime Projects

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio â€” a curated collection of my hands-on projects, research, and learning milestones in cybersecurity, machine learning, and threat intelligence. These works were developed during the **3MTT Nigeria program**, personal R&D, and my **M.Sc in Computer Science**.

Each project highlights a specific challenge in the cybersecurity landscape â€” from real-time detection of fake alerts to threat intelligence automation and ML-based attack prediction.

## 2. Advanced Cybersecurity Research

### Detection of Vampire Attacks in WSNs Using Machine Learning  
**[View Project Folder Â»](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yHyXQvCGOKQHpFm_9ckFko44TGIZwbrK)**

This master's research focuses on detecting **vampire attacks**â€”a type of resource-draining attackâ€”in wireless sensor networks. It uses **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** for predictive modeling.

#### Contents:
- Preprocessed Dataset: `WSN-DS-Preprocessed.csv`
- Trained Models: `best_rf_model.pkl`, `best_xgb_model.pkl`
- Performance Metrics:
  - Confusion Matrices
  - ROC Curves (Per-Class + Combined)
  - Classification Reports

#### Tools & Tech:
`Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `Jupyter Notebook`

### Evaluation of Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing Platforms  
**[View Project Folder Â»](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yHZsMWb38I17fO4UASfoCDz-X1_iOSNO)**

This project evaluates and compares **CTI-sharing platforms** such as **AlienVault OTX** and **VirusTotal** for their effectiveness in collaborative threat detection.

#### Key Files:
- Real-time and combined datasets (`cleaned_realtime.csv`, `cti_combined_dataset.csv`)
- Threat indicator expansion outputs
- Jupyter Notebook for threat similarity analysis

#### Outcomes:
- Comparative insights into CTI data quality
- Similarity scoring and detection overlap evaluation
